## Wilderness Expedition and Discovery attempts

Since academic year 2010-2011, 7,445 attempts to complete either PED 015 Discovery or PED 016 La Vida Wilderness Expedition have been made by 6,691 students.

**Summary**

-   Over time, Gordon students have become less likely to attempt the La Vida Wilderness Expedition (LVWE).

-   Among those who do participate in the LVWE during their first year, increasingly more are doing so the summer before entering as freshman.

-   Over the last 15 academic year, Discovery has largely been attempted during one of the first two quads.
