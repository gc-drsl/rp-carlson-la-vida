## Wilderness Expedition and Discovery attempts

Since academic year 2010-2011, 7,445 attempts to complete either PED 015 Discovery or PED 016 La Vida Wilderness Expedition have been made by 6,691 students.

::: callout-note
### Section summary

-   Over time, Gordon students have become less likely to attempt the La Vida Wilderness Expedition.

-   Among those who do participate in the Wilderness Expedition during their first year, increasingly more are doing so the summer before entering as freshman.

-   Over the last 15 academic year, Discovery has largely been attempted during one of the first two quads.

## Course outcomes

::: callout-note
### Section summary

-   Pass rates for both the Wilderness Expedition and Discovery are consistently high (in the mid- to high-90s), though Discovery pass rates are generally slightly lower

-   Fail and withdraw rates tend be slightly lower among students attempting the Wilderness Expedition

### Pass, fail, withdraw rates

Of the 7,445 attempts examined above, 956 (12.8%) ended as dropped courses. A course may be dropped by a student for scheduling reasons, or a section may be cancelled (appearing in Jenzabar as a drop) due to low enrollment, insufficient staffing, or health and safety concerns. The tables below were built using data that excluded dropped course attempts.
